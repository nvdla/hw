Title: TLM Review
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides a basic introduction to TLM ports, exports, interfaces,
and sockets as well as basic rules for connecting them. See the <References>
section for more in-depth materials, including the IEEE 1666-2011, the SystemC
LRM that defines the TLM standard.


Topic: Terms
------------

Definitions of terms used throughout this document.

SV  - SystemVerilog, or UVM in SystemVerilog. The context
      will make clear which. In figures, UVM SV components are shown in blue.

SC  - SystemC. In figures, SC components are shown in yellow.

model - Functionality encapsulated by a class. A model is typically a
      subtypes (derived from) of ~sc_module~ in SC and ~uvm_component~
      in SV. Although dynamic in nature, models deriving from these classes
      are quasi-static; they are created during elaboration of the testbench
      and continue to exist throughout simulation. 

component - Synonymous with ~model~, above.

hierarchical component - A model contains one or more models.

TLM - Transaction-Level Model. TLM models exchange information as objects,
      not the discrete signals or wires you see in RTL. Transactions abstract
      away the low-level RTL details in exchange for speed and easier
      maintenance. To be reusable, TLM models should communicate via
      standard TLM1 or TLM2 interfaces.

interface - A class that defines one or more method prototypes but does
      not implement them. Classes inheriting from an interface must implement
      the methods defined in the interface. TLM1 and TLM2 define several
      interfaces for transaction-level communication. Models that implement
      an interface are referred to as ~targets~.

imp - SV only. Like an interface, except instead of providing an interface
      implementation through inheritance, the ~imp~ is an object that provides
      an interface through delegation. It is a SV workaround to lack of
      multiple inheritance.

export - An object that conveys (exports) an interface implementation from
      the child to the parent level. Exports can also be connected to other
      exports for purposes of promoting the interface implementation as
      high in the model hierarchy as needed.

port - An object through which interface calls are made. A port is connected to
      the interface implementation via a combination of parent port-export-imp
      connections. Thus, calls to a port in an initiator component end up
      calling the method implementations in the target component, with neither
      the initiator nor target knowing about each other.
    
Who initiates requests and who services them dictates the control flow 
relationship between models. 

initiator - A component that initiates transaction requests. Initiators
      typically contain at least one port or initiator_socket.

target - A component to which transaction requests are sent. Targets
      typically implement an interface (SC) or contain at an initiator_socket
      or imp.

Who creates the transactions and who processes them dictate the data flow
relationship between models.

producer - A component that produces transactions.

consumer - A component that consumes or executes transactions.


There are thus four combinations of control and data flow possible for any
given TLM connection.

- ~Initiator-producers~ create transactions and send them out TLM ports or sockets.

- ~Target-consumers~ receive transactions from initiator-producers via TLM exports,
  interfaces, imps, or sockets. ~Initiator-consumers~ request transactions from
  target-producers via TLM ports or sockets.
  
- ~Initiator-consumers~ request transactions from connected ~target-producers~.
  Although it does not use a standard TLM interface, the UVM driver is an example
  of a ~initiator-consumer~.

- ~Target-producers~ create transactions upon request from ~initiator-consumers~. 
  Although not a component using standard TLM, the UVM sequencer is an example of
  a ~target-producer~, accepting requests for transactions from the driver.



Topic: Context Independence
---------------------------

The purpose of TLM is to allow components to be self-contained, independent
of the myriad ways they might be connected in a testbench. Likewise,
connections should be not depend on the components' internal implementation
details. The TLM standard defines the set of common interfaces and semantics
required to make successful connections to independently developed components.

Provided the IP you intend to integrate has properly applied the principles of
context independence and TLM connectivity, mixed-language interoperability
with UVMC can be achieved with no modifications to the IP on either side
of the language boundary. 

The examples included in this kit reinforce these concepts. All examples are
fully documented with diagrams, explanations, and code in hyperlinked HTML.
Together they show you step-by-step how to integrate existing IP in a mixed
SystemC / SystemVerilog environment.



Topic: Ports
------------

Ports are used to call interface methods implemented elsewhere.

- Ports are the "starting point" for communication by initiators 
- The testbench developer (integrator) connects ports external to the owner
  of th eport.
- Ports are depicted as square in diagrams

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_Ports.png)

SC Example:

| class producer : public sc_module
| {
|   sc_port<tlm_blocking_put_if<packet> > out;  <--
|
|   producer(sc_module_name nm) : out("out"){ 
|      SC_THREAD(run);
|   }
|
|   void run() {
|      packet t;
|      ...initialize/randomize packet...
|      out->put(t); <--
|   }
|
| };

SV Example:

| class producer extends uvm_component
| {
|   tlm_blocking_put_port #(packet) out; <--
|
|   `uvm_component_utils(producer)
|
|   function new (string name, uvm_component parent=null);
|     super.new(name,parent);
|     out = new("out",  this);
|   endfunction
|
|   virtual task run_phase (uvm_phase phase);
|     packet t = packet::type_id::create("tr",this);
|     t.randomize();
|     `uvm_info("PRODUCER/PKT/SEND", t.sprint(),UVM_MEDIUM)
|     out.put(t);   <--
|   endtask
| };



Topic: Interfaces & Imps
------------------------

An ~interface~ in SC and an ~imp~ in SV UVM are used to expose to the outside world
an implementation of a standard TLM interface, which is a group of methods with
predefined signatures and semantics. The interface is typically a small subset
of a component's overall API. Thus, the TLM interface and imp minimize the
coupling between components by exposing only the standard portion of its API.

- Imps/interfaces are "end points" in a network of port/export/interface connections

- Inteface methods are called via ports bound to the interface/imp, NOT directly


- Interfaces/imps are depicted as a circle in diagrams


SC Example:

In SC, target components inherit the interface & implement the interface's methods

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_Interfaces.png)

| class consumer : public sc_module,
|                  tlm_blocking_put_if<packet> <-- interface inherited
| {
|    public:
|    consumer(sc_module_name nm) { }
| 
|   virtual void put(const packet &t) {    <-- implementation
|     cout << "Got packet: " << t << endl;
|     wait(10,SC_NS);
|   }
| };


SV Example:

In SV, target components provide an "imp" object for connecting to the outside
world. The ~imp~ delegates to the interface implementations provided
in the component.

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_Imps.png)

| class consumer extends uvm_component;
|
|   uvm_blocking_put_imp #(packet,consumer) in;  <-- imp object
|
|   `uvm_component_utils(consumer)
|
|    function new(string name, uvm_component parent=null);
|       super.new(name,parent);
|       in = new("in",  this);
|    endfunction
|
|    virtual task put (packet t);   <-- implementation
|      `uvm_info("CONSUMER/PKT/RECV",
|                 t.sprint(),UVM_MEDIUM)
|      #10ns;
|    endtask
|
| endclass



Topic: Exports
--------------

Exports promote an interface (or imp) implementation from a child to its parent.

- Promotes (exports) interface implementations from a child  (or self) up a level

- Internally bound to child export, imp / interface in c'tor

- Externally connected to port or parent export, but not required.
  (If no connection, no activity) 

- Exports are depicted as circle in diagrams


SC Example:

Often, an SC component that implements an interface may provide that interface
via an explicit export object, much like the ~imp~ provides an interface in SV.
In this case, the SC Target binds its own interface implementation to the export.
Then, a port can be connected directly to the export, e.g. ~prod.out.bind(cons.in);~

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_Export_Self.png)

| class consumer : public sc_module,
|                  tlm_blocking_put_if<packet>
| {
|   public:
|
|   sc_export<tlm_blocking_put_if<packet> > in;  <-- export
|   
|   consumer(sc_module_name nm) : in("in") {
|     in(*this);                  <-- promote own intf impl
|   }
| 
|  virtual void put(const packet &t) {
|     cout << "Got packet: " << t << endl;
|     wait(10,SC_NS);
|   }
| };


SV Example:

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_Export_Imp.png)

| class parent extends uvm_component;
|
|   uvm_blocking_put_export #(packet) in;
|
|   consumer cons; 
|
|   `uvm_component_utils(consumer)
|
|   function new(string name, uvm_component parent=null);
|      super.new(name,parent);
|      in = new("in",  this);
|   endfunction
|
|   function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
|     cons=consumer::type_id::create("const",this);
|   endfunction
|
|   function void connect_phase(uvm_phase phase);
|     in.connect(consumer.in);
|   endfunction
|
| endclass



Topic: Analysis
---------------

Analysis ports, exports, and imps are used to monitor transaction
flow and help you debug your designs. Components emitting transactions
out an analysis port are not necessarily the producers of those
transactions. In all cases, components receiving transactions from
an analysis connection do not execute them or modify them in any way.

Analysis Ports:

Analysis ports are a special kind of TLM port. They publish 
transactions to any number of listeners, including zero.

- Broadcasts ("publishes") to all connected targets ("subscribers") 

- Transactions are read-only. Used for debug, scoreboards, etc. 

- Usually does not require connection (SC_ZERO_OR_MORE_BOUND) 

- Depicted as diamond in diagrams


SC Example:

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_Analysis_Ports.png)

| class monitor: public sc_module
| {
|   sc_port<tlm_analysis_if<packet>,
|           0, SC_ZERO_OR_MORE_BOUND> > ap;
|
|   monitor(sc_module_name nm) : ap("ap"){ 
|      SC_THREAD(run);
|   }
|   void run() {
|      packet t;
|      ...gather packet off bus...
|      ap->write( t );  <--
|   }
| };


Analysis Exports & Imps:

Analysis exports and imps are subscribers to a TLM analysis port.

- Receives streams of transactions from connected publisher (e.g. monitor) 
- Transactions are read-only, i.e. for debugging, scoreboarding, etc. 
- Like all exports and imps, does not typically ~require~ a connection 
- Depicted as circle in diagrams


SV Example:

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_Analysis_Imps.png)

| class scoreboard extends uvm_component;
|
|    uvm_analysis_imp #(packet,scoreboard) actual_in;  <-- imp
|
|    `uvm_component_utils(scoreboard)
|
|    function new(string name, uvm_component parent=null);
|       super.new(name,parent);
|       actual_in = new("actual_in", this);
|       ...
|    endfunction
|
|    virtual function void write(packet t); <-- called by actual_in
|      packet exp;
|      `uvm_info("SB/PKT/RECV",t.sprint(),UVM_MEDIUM)
|      if (!expect_fifo.try_get(exp)) ...error
|      if (!t.compare(exp)) ...error
|    endfunction
| endclass




Topic: TLM Initiator Socket
---------------------------

Sockets are a convenient way to make TLM2 connections; in fact, most
TLM2 connections are made with sockets, not individual interface
connections.

- Can do blocking or non-blocking transport (usually one or the other)

- Default type is ~tlm_generic_payload~ with base protocol semantics

- Initiator must implement backward interface,
  unless a simple initiator socket is used (in tlm_utils namespace)

- When driving an SV target, the ~DMI~ and ~debug~ interface calls
  will be ignored, as they are not implemented in SV.

- When driving an SC target from SV, the ~DMI~ and ~debug~ interfaces
  will not be called, so your SC models should not rely on them
  being called.
  
- Depicted as square with outward facing arrow

SC Example:

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_InitiatorSocket.png)

| struct producer: public sc_module,
|                  public tlm_bw_transport_if< >
| {
|   tlm::tlm_initiator_socket< > out; // default: tlm_gp
|
|   producer (sc_module_name nm) : out("out") {
|     out(*this); // bind bw intf to self
|     SC_THREAD(fw_proc);
|   }
|
|   // FORWARD PATH
|
|   void fw_proc() {
|     // produce tlm gp trans, then emit using...
|     out->b_transport(t,del);
|        *or*
|     out->nb_transport_fw(t,ph,del);
|   }
|
|   // BACKWARD PATH
|
|   virtual tlm_sync_enum nb_transport_bw(...) {
|     ...coordinate with fw path, per protocol
|   }
|
|   virtual void invalidate_direct_mem_ptr(...) {
|     // Dummy implementation
|   }
| };



Topic: TLM Target Socket
------------------------

A component having a target socket receives transaction on its forward
interface and, if non-blocking, sends responses to the initiator via
the backward path.

Some other key aspects of target sockets include

- They implement both blocking or non-blocking transport interface,
  although the connected initiator typically uses one or the other.

- The default transaction type is the ~tlm_generic_payload~
  executed with ~TLM base protocol~ semantics

- The target model must implement all of forward interface
  unless the simple target socket is used, in which case only
  those methods that are registered need to be implemented.

- Because UVM SV does not support the direct memory and debug interfaces,
  UVMC stubs these out. Attempts to use these interfaces by SV initiators
  will be ignored.

- Sockets are depicted in diagrams as a square with inward facing arrow.

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_TargetSocket.png)

SC example:

| struct consumer: public sc_module,
|                  public tlm_fw_transport_if< > {
|
|   tlm::tlm_target_socket< > in;
|
|   consumer(sc_module_name nm) : in("in") {
|     in.bind(*this);     SC_THREAD(bw_proc);
|   }
|
|   // FORWARD PATH
|
|   void b_transport( packet& trans,sc_time& t ) { 
|     // fully execute request, modify args, return
|   }
|
|   tlm_sync_enum nb_transport_fw(...) {
|     // per protocol, update args as allowed,return
|   }
|
|   bool get_direct_mem_ptr() { return FALSE; }
|
|   unsigned int transport_dbg() { return 0; }
| 
|
|   // BACKWARD PATH
|
|   void bw_proc() {
|      ...coordinate with fw transport per protocol
|      in->nb_transport_bw(trans,ph,delay);
|   }
| };



Topic: Socket Connections
-------------------------

A socket is used to connect a forward and backward path between
an initiator and target using a single ~connect~ or ~bind~ call.
Although sockets support both blocking and non-blocking semantics,
typically only one of them is in play for any given connection.


Blocking Transport:

- Initiator indirectly calls ~b_transport~ in Target 

- Initiator must not modify transaction; transaction contents
  invalid until ~b_transport~ returns 

- When ~b_transport~ returns, transaction is complete with status/results 

- Transaction can be reused in next ~b_transport~ call

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_BTransportSocket.png)


Non-blocking Transport using Base Protocol:

- Initiator starts request by calling ~nb_transport_fw~ in Target.
  Target returns with updated arguments.

- Target can call ~nb_transport_bw~ in Initiator at phase transitions.
  To provide Initiator updates; Initiator may respond via fw interface.

- Transaction contents, phase, & delay can change.
  Only certain fields in certain phases, according to base protocol rules.

- Transport calls continue back and forth until either returns transaction
  complete status. For efficiency, the same transaction handle is used
  throughout its execution.

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_NBTransportSocket.png)



Topic: Legal TLM Connections
----------------------------

TLM port connections are like Verilog module port connections except you're
connecting interfaces not wires. Control and data flow through each TLM
connection can be in opposite directions.

A successful connection requires a given pair of ports to agree on the interface
and transaction types as well as the direction of control and data flow.

Ports   - Ports can connect/bind to parent ports, sibling exports,
          and sibling interfaces/imps. ~prod.port.bind(port|export|intf|imp)~

Exports - Exports can connect/bind to child exports and child interfaces/imps.
          ~export.bind(export|imp|interface)~

Interfaces (SC) - Interfaces in Systemc are pure virtual classes that are
          inherited by target. They are never on the left-hand side of
          a bind or connect call.

Imps (SV) - Imps in SV are implicitly bound to the parent in the parent's
          constructor. ~imp = new("name", this)~, where ~this~ is the
          parent.  They are never on the left-hand side of a bind or
          connect call.

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_ITPC_Connections.png)


A connection is hierarchical when a port connects to a parent port or an export
connects to a child export, interface, or imp.  The following figure shows
the legal port-export-imp-interface connections. Passthrough TLM sockets in SV UVM
are used to make hierarchical socket connections.

(see UVMC_TLM_Overview_Hierarchical.png)




Topic: TLM Generic Payload
--------------------------

TLM 2.0 defines a canonical transaction type, ~tlm_generic_payload~, or
~tlm_gp~ for short. TLM 2.0 also defines a base protocol for execution of
the generic payload over standard initiator and target sockets.

When used together--~tlm_gp~ with the ~base protocol~--interoperability 
potential is at its highest.

The TLM GP defines the following major fields. 

  command         - READ, WRITE, or IGNORE

  address         - Base address

  data            - Data buffer. An array of bytes

  data_length     - Number of valid bytes in data buffer

  response_status - OK, INCOMPLETE, GENERIC_ERROR, ADDRESS_ERROR,
                    BURST_ERROR, etc.

  byte_enable     - Byte-enable data buffer

  byte_enable_length - Number of valid byte-enables buffer

Between SystemC, UVM, and the UVMC libraries, the tlm generic payload
transaction definitions and converters come pre-defined for you. You do
not need to define converters for ~tlm_gp~. You can just connect and go!



Topic: TLM1 combination interfaces
----------------------------------

TLM ports ~require~ a connection to an implementation of
its interface type, while TLM exports, interfaces, and imps ~provide~
the implementation. As long as the provider provides ~at least~ the
required interface, the connection is allowed.

In most connections, you will be connecting TLM ports that are typed to
matching interfaces, e.g. a ~uvm_tlm_blocking_put_port #(my_trans)~
would be connected to a ~uvm_tlm_blocking_put_imp #(my_trans)~, or in SC,
an ~sc_port< tlm_blocking_put_if<my_trans> >~ would be connected to
a component implementing (inheriting) ~tlm_blocking_put_if<my_trans>~.

To increase connection options for integrators, a VIP designer may opt
to provide both the blocking and non-blocking interfaces, e.g. provide
a ~uvm_tlm_put_imp #(my_tras)~. Integrators may connect to this any of
~uvm_tlm_blocking_put_port #(my_trans)~, 
~uvm_tlm_nonblocking_put_port #(my_trans)~,  or of course 
~uvm_tlm_put_port #(my_trans)~.

As you will see in the chapter on <UVMC Connections>, the same
options when making connections that cross the language boundary.


Topic: UVMC TLM Connections
---------------------------

Getting your SystemC TLM models and SystemVerilog UVM components talking to
each other breaks down to two steps

- Define converters, if necessary

- Make connections

If you're not using the TLM generic payload, you must
define compatible transaction classes in SV and SC and
the converters to go between them. If the transactions and the components that
use them are pre-existing, this task entails writing a custom converter
class that not only packs and unpacks but adapts to the differences
in member types, member number, and declaration order between the two
classes.

If a transaction type pre-exists in one language but not the other,
you would need to define the missing transaction type first, then define the
converters to go between it and the original transaction. Try to define
the class to match the existing definition as closely as possible.

In UVM, your transaction should extend uvm_sequence_item. It must implement
the ~do_pack~ and ~do_unpack~ methods, or it must use the ~`uvm_field~
macros (not recommended). The number, order, and manner of
unpacking must be compatible with that for unpacking. Typically,
one is the exact reverse of the other.
